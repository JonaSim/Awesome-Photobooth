# Awesome-Photobooth
All code and images needed for an awesome RaspberryPi-powered photobooth.

In order to make it work right off the bat, just extract and store the main folder in the pi-directory. Then execute the "photo_booth_script.py" in the console. (You can find the file in the scripts-folder-)
